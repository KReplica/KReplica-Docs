<p>If you're new to KReplica, I implore you to check the <a href="/playground" hx-get="/playground"
                                                            hx-target=".main-content" hx-push-url="true"
                                                            hx-indicator=".page-progress">Playground</a> as well. Since
    this is a code generation tool, I believe itâ€™s very useful to see a side-by-side view of the input and codegen
    output.</p>
