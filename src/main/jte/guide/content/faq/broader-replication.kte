<h3>Can a <code>@Replicate.Property</code> have a broader replication than its <code>@Replicate.Model</code>?</h3>

<p>No. The restriction of all properties must be a subset of the parent model's variants. This ensures
    fail-fast feedback. If you restrict a parent's replication but forget to update a child property, you'll
    get an immediate build-time error instead of a silent failure.</p>
