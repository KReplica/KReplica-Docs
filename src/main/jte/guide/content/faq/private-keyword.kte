<h3>Why do all the examples use the <code>private</code> keyword (<code>private interface</code>)?</h3>

<p>The <code>private</code> keyword is not required, but it's a recommended practice. The source interfaces
    are only for KReplica's use; your application code will interact with the generated DTOs. Making them
    private prevents them from polluting the global namespace. This is especially useful for versioned
    schemas, as it allows you to nest versions (e.g., <code>private interface V1 : UserAccount</code>)
    inside a parent scope, avoiding naming collisions.</p>
