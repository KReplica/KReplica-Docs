<h3>If a <code>@Replicate.Model</code> has another <code>@Replicate.Model</code> as a field, does the order of
    compilation matter?</h3>

<p>No. KReplica uses a two-pass compilation strategy. It first generates stub files for all
    <code>@Replicate.Model</code>
    declarations to make their types known, then performs the main compilation. This ensures that nested
    models resolve correctly regardless of file order.</p>
